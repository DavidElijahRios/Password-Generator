# Password-Generator

## Description

The objective and reason for this project was to use Javascript to give life to a password-generating application that responded with the user in order to provide them with a secure and unique password. It solves the problem of having to randomly think of a random password and generate one that can be copied and save somewhere secure for easy access to it. I learn that through simple prompts and boolean expression JavaScript can be quite powerful and intuitive.
